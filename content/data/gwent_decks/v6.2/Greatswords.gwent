--- Description

Skellige deck that relies on **An Craite Greatswords** and **Dagur** getting boosted when the opponent's units get
damaged. In combination with **Morkvarg** and **Wild Boar of the Sea** this can be used for a big swing the last turn.


This is one of the Decks that got me to Pro Rank for the first time (**Season of the Viper**, 2020).
