--- Description

This is one of the Decks that got me to Pro Rank for the first time (**Season of the Viper**, 2020). Still a pretty
good deck despite the nerf the Leader ability got at the start of the season. As the deck is somewhat top-heavy and
contains several high provision gold cards, not drawing these can be problematic. While the leader in combination with
**Vissegerd** can put quite a few points on the board, being bled in round two can be problematic.
