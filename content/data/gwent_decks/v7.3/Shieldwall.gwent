--- Description

Despite struggling against this deck, indicating it was very strong during the **Season of the Cat**, I didn't put up
good results with it. Ended at 2431 fMMR which isn't great, despite having played a decent number of games with it.
Might be a bit more analytical during the next season and figure out what I was doing wrong and try to improve.
